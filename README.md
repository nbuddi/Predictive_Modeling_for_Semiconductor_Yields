# Predictive_Modeling_for_Semiconductor_Yields
This project aims to reduce manufacturing waste in semiconductor fabrication by predicting wafer failure early in the production cycle. Using the SECOM dataset (1,567 wafers, 591 sensors), I performed extensive data cleaning, handled extreme class imbalance, and developed a predictive model.
